```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r logo, fig.cap = "Source: [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)", fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("tidydata.png"))
```

### Motivation
This repo houses my submissions to the weekly [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data project. Using R and modern tools such as `{ggplot2}`, `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, and other tools in the  [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) package, I hope to improve my data wrangling and visualization skills. As well, this a great outlet for me to experiment and go crazy as graphs for manuscripts are much more conservative. Furthermore, I hope to document my improvements!
