### Motivation

This repo houses my submissions to the weekly
[\#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data
project. Using R and modern tools such as
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), I hope to improve my data
wrangling and visualization skills, As well, this a great outlet for me
to experiment and go crazy as graphs for manuscripts are much more
conservative. As well, I hope to document my improvements!

Karamanis](https://github.com/gkaramanis) for inspiration.
